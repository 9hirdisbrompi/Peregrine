Le Dodici Fatiche di Asterix tells the story of how Asterix and Obelix have to complete twelve impossible tasks set by Julius Caesar in order to prove that they are not gods, but mere mortals. The tasks include running faster than a champion athlete, surviving a haunted house, crossing a lake full of crocodiles, and even making a bored bureaucrat laugh. Along the way, they encounter many hilarious situations and characters, such as a Germanic warrior who speaks in rhymes, a hypnotist who can make anyone fall asleep, and a sibyl who predicts their future.
