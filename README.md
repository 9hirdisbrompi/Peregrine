# Swallow

Swallow is a compiled programming language currently under development. Docs coming soon.

# Why am I creating this language?

I am creating it as a fast alternative to Python and an easy one to C.

# Goals

- Ease of use
- Fast
- Highly modular
- Occupies less memory
- Compiled

# How does it work?

You can consider it to be a superset of C which compiles to clean C. So valid c code is also valid Swallow code (the language is named Swallow). It will have no garbage collector because it is a system programming language but it will be very easy to use so there will be less chance of memory leak.

# Requirements to build from source
 - Gcc compiler
 - V compiler

# Build instruction
 
- Clone this repository using the following command -> `git clone https://github.com/Swallow-lang/swallow.git`
- Run `cd swallow/swallow`
- To build it run `v swallow.v`
- That's it

# Primary implementation language

For now it is written in V (visit vlang.io for more info) but in the future it will be self hosted.

# Progress

Currently we are working on the codegen and some swallow programs are working :)

# Example

Here is a small example for you to understand:
```
def main():
    print("hi")
```
The `main` function is the entry point for the program.
