# Swallow

Swallow is a compiled programming language currently under development. Docs coming soon

# Why am I creating this language?

I am creating it as a fast alternative to python and as an easy alternative to c

# Goals

- Ease to use
- Fast
- Highly modular
- Occupies less memory
- Compiled

# How does it work?

You can consider it to be a superset of c which compiles to clean c. So valid c code is also valid swallow code(the language is named swallow). It will have no garbage collector because it is a system programming language but it will be very easy to use so there will be less chance of memory leak

# Primary implementation language

For now it is written in v(visit vlang.io for more info) but in the future it will be self hosted

# Progress

Currently we are working on the codegen and some swallow programs are working :)

# Example

Here is a small example for you to understand
```
def main():
    print("hi")
```
The main function is the entry point for the program
