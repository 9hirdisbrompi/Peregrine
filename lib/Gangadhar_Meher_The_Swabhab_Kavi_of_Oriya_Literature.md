Gangadhar Meher was born in a poor weaver's family in Barpali, a small town in present-day Bargarh district of Orissa. He had a limited formal education, but he had an excessive desire for reading and learning. He read the Oriya Ramayan and Mahabharat by Balaram Das and Sarala Das respectively, as well as many Sanskrit classics such as Raghubansam by Kalidasa. He also read Tulsi Ramayan in Hindi and Bengali magazines and newspapers. He started writing poems at an early age and soon earned fame and recognition for his poetic talent.
 
Gangadhar Meher worked as a village teacher, a weaver, a patwari and a moharir under the zamindar of Barpali. He faced many hardships and challenges in his life, but he never gave up his passion for poetry. He wrote more than 100 poems in Oriya, which are collected in his books such as Pranaya Ballari, Kichaka Badha, Tapaswini, Indumati, Arghyathali, Pranaya Gitika and Gangadhar Granthabali. His poems are marked by originality, simplicity, lyricism and musicality. He also translated some Sanskrit works into Oriya, such as Meghaduta and Kumarasambhava by Kalidasa.
 
Gangadhar Meher is regarded as one of the greatest poets of Oriya literature. He is also considered as a pioneer of modern Oriya poetry, as he introduced new forms and styles in his poems. He influenced many later poets such as Radhanath Ray, Fakir Mohan Senapati and Madhusudan Rao. He was honoured with the title of Swabhab Kavi by Utkal Gourav Madhusudan Das, the father of modern Orissa. He was also awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award posthumously in 1965 for his Gangadhar Granthabali.
